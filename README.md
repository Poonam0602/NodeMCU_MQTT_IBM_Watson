# NodeMCU_MQTT_IBM_Watson

This project demonstrates how to use ESP8266 as IoT MQTT device which pushes data to IBM Watson IoT platform.


### Prerequisites

Install arduino libraries 

```
ESPTool
```

For ESPMQTT_WithBuffer&TimeStamp.ino, we need two more libraries.

```
DHT
RingBuffer
```

### Code Explaination
